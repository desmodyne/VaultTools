# VaultTools

A [DesmoDyne](https://www.desmodyne.com) project that provides tools focussed on working with [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) as a secrets management solution.

The tools in this project are mostly targeted at macOS, but are intended to work cross-platform, so they might also be usable on Linux (or other *nixes), possibly with minor modifications.
